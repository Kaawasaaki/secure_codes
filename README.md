# secure_codes
a compilation of codes which ensure safe allocation and deallocation of memory blocks while coding

This repository is a response to a previous repository containing unsecure practices while coding with c/c++

the program files implement calloc, malloc and realloc. within each program, there conatins 10 - 15 test cases for each memory allocation function to check if the memory function is being implemented properly.

Hence the main goal is to ensure that the program is fully executed(Including test cases) without returning any error during compilation
